Hello and Welcome! :smiley::wave: 


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm Tilendra Choudhary, a post-doctoral data scientist and researcher at [<b>Duke University, USA</b>](https://duke.edu/) <i class="fa-solid fa-building-columns"></i>. I'm currently working at the [<b>Kamaleswaran Lab</b>](https://www.kamaleswaran.com/home) led by [<b>Dr. Rishikesan Kamaleswaran</b>](https://surgery.duke.edu/profile/rishi-kamaleswaran) with a focus on <b>data science</b>, <b>signal processing</b>, and <b>machine learning</b>. Before joining Duke, I have worked closely with <b>Emory + GeorgiaTech Univ.</b> (as post-doc) and <b>Brigosha Technologies R&D</b> (as Research Engineer). As an AI enthusiast, I'm endlessly fascinated by new technologies and innovations in the fields of electronics and computer science. My current research interests are centered around physiological signal processing, health informatics, and applying AI and ML to healthcare and beyond. Outside of my technical work, I have a deep appreciation for spiritual scriptures, which offer a unique perspective on life and knowledge :open_book:.
