## Description
Analyzing critical illnesses for their early diagnosis, prognosis, clinical progession, treatment effects, and personalized therapy optimization comes under my research interest. It is highly fascinating to see how advanced ML, DL and reinforcement-learning tools are used to interpret disease progression and render many realtime clinical applications in healthcare. Clinical data such as vitals, labs, waveforms, x-rays and CT-scans are frequently measured  from such critically ill patients, which are used in ML-models building process for their prospective decision making. Despite having similar demographics and admission co-morbidities, factors affecting differences in clinical course and outcomes seen in patients cannot be ignored. My interests in this domain include the study of Sepsis, ARF, ARDS, Septic-Shock, Blood Transfusion and others.
