## Description
Traffic scene perception and analysis is a crucial part for autonomous driving and ADAS systems. With new 2-D and 3-D deep learning models, scene perception becomes quite easier and improved especially when multimodality of sensor data information is fused smartly. Situation becomes challenging when the car's sensors detect a high density of vehicles, pedestrians, and other objects within its field of vision, making it difficult to accurately track and navigate around them, often leading to a need for caution and potential braking actions due to the perceived risk of collision.
